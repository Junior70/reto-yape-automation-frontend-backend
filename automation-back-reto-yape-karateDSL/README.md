# Execution of Scenarios

must have maven and Java installed

# Getting Started

Execute the command as all scenarios have the same label

- [@TestJRK]()

# Considerations

- run the Add New PetStore test first
- copy the number and replace it in the feature FinPet and UpdatePet
- after that run it from the same maven or console with the command mvn test "-Dkarate.options=--tags @TestJRK".
